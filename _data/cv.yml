        - <b>Design of a novel explainer for GNN node classification</b><ul><li>"Distill n' Explain" (<b>AISTATS 2023</b>) first distills the original GNN into an interpretable one and then explains the latter.</li><li>Designed and proved lemmas and theorems that guarantee the method's explanation faithfulness.</li><li>The proposed explainer outperformed previous methods in explanation accuracy while being orders of magnitude faster.</li></ul>    
        - <b>Development of a visual analytics system to explore citations in legal documents</b><ul><li>"LegalVis" (<b>TVCG 2023</b>, <b>VIS 2022</b>, BSc Thesis) employs ML, NLP, XAI, and data visualization to infer non-explicit citations in Brazilian legal documents.</li><li>Tested a diverse set of NLP classifiers (Transformers, word embeddings, and bag-of-words) and achieved high accuracy (96%) in identifying citations.</li><li>Employed a model-agnostic explainer (LIME) to explain the inferred citations.</li></ul>
