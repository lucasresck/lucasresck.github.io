Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a MSc student in Mathematical Modeling at the School of Applied Mathematics of FundaÃ§Ã£o Getulio Vargas ([FGV EMAp](https://emap.fgv.br/en)), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and I'm **actively seeking PhD opportunities**.

I hold a BSc in Applied Mathematics at FGV EMAp (2021) and I'm a member of the [Visual Data Science Lab](http://visualdslab.com/) of FGV EMAp (since 2020), where I develop research in NLP and XAI. In 2022 I visited the [Vision, Language, and Learning Lab](https://vislang.ai/) at Rice University, Houston, to develop research ideas in XAI. I also have experience in projects applying machine learning, NLP, XAI, and data visualization in legal problems.

Research interests:
  - Machine Learning
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence
