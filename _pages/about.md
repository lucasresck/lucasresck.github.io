Hi there! 👋

I'm an MSc student in Mathematical Modeling at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en/school) at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Check my [publications](https://lucasresck.github.io/publications/) at **NAACL Findings**, **AISTATS**, and **TVCG**!

I hold a BSc in Applied Mathematics at FGV (2021) and I'm a member of the [Visual Data Science Lab](http://visualdslab.com/) at FGV (since 2020), where I develop research in NLP and XAI. In 2022, I visited the [Vision, Language, and Learning Lab](https://vislang.ai/) at Rice University, Houston, to develop research ideas in XAI. I also have experience in projects applying ML, NLP, XAI, and Data Visualization in legal problems.

Research interests:
  - **Machine Learning** (ML)
  - **Natural Language Processing** (NLP)
  - **Explainable AI** (XAI)
