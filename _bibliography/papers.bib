	abstract = {The Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) is the highest law court in Brazil and it is primarily responsible for guarding the Brazilian Constitution. To reduce judicial insecurity and the high Court’s workload, a Constitutional Amendment from 2004 allowed STF to create binding precedents (“Súmulas Vinculantes,” BPs). A BP is a statement that consolidates the understanding of STF about a legal matter and has mandatory application for lower branches of the Judiciary. Frequently, an STF Justice cites a BP in a decision, and it is trivial to search for these explicit citations using regular expressions. However, it is not trivial to assert whether a decision potentially cites the statement, in the sense of “it should have cited it, but it did not” or “it addresses a similar issue, so they are related.” This work explores machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to infer and explain these potential citations. The inference is performed using models from classical machine learning theory and recent NLP research, and the explanation is achieved using a machine learning explainability technique. The models learn what characterizes a citation through training on documents with explicit citations, in which we demonstrate they achieve high performance. We present two case studies that demonstrate the usefulness of the trained models to search for potential citations when accompanied 
by the explainability technique to inform the most relevant parts of the document for the potential citation assignment.},

	abstract = {Explaining node predictions in graph neural networks (GNNs) often boils down to finding graph substructures that preserve predictions. Finding these structures usually implies back-propagating through the GNN, bonding the complexity (e.g., number of layers) of the GNN to the cost of explaining it. This naturally begs the question: Can we break this bond by explaining a simpler surrogate GNN? To answer the question, we propose Distill n’ Explain (DnX). First, DnX learns a surrogate GNN via knowledge distillation. Then, DnX extracts node or edge-level explanations by solving a simple convex program. We also propose FastDnX, a faster version of DnX that leverages the linear decomposition of our surrogate model. Experiments show that DnX and FastDnX often outperform state-of-the-art GNN explainers while being orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, we support our empirical findings with theoretical results linking the quality of the surrogate model (i.e., distillation error) to the faithfulness of explanations.},

	abstract = {To reduce the number of pending cases and conflicting rulings in the Brazilian Judiciary, the National Congress amended the Constitution, allowing the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) to create binding precedents (BPs), i.e., a set of understandings that both Executive and lower Judiciary branches must follow. The STF’s justices frequently cite the 58 existing BPs in their decisions, and it is of primary relevance that judicial experts could identify and analyze such citations. To assist in this problem, we propose LegalVis, a web-based visual analytics system designed to support the analysis of legal documents that cite or could potentially cite a BP. We model the problem of identifying potential citations (i.e., non-explicit) as a classification problem. However, a simple score is not enough to explain the results; that is why we use an interpretability machine learning method to explain the reason behind each identified citation. For a compelling visual exploration of documents and BPs, LegalVis comprises three interactive visual components: the first presents an overview of the data showing temporal patterns, the second allows filtering and grouping relevant documents by topic, and the last one shows a document’s text aiming to interpret the model’s output by pointing out which paragraphs are likely to mention the BP, even if not explicitly specified. We evaluated our identification model and obtained an accuracy of 96\%; we also made a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results. The usefulness and effectiveness of LegalVis were evaluated through two usage scenarios and feedback from six domain experts.},
